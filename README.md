# MDEF_David-Flavio_Micro-Challenge
A dual-purpose analog speaker that doubles as a table/chair, amplifying sound to create a social bubble around music and food.

The research will try to explore the possibility of creating recreational interaction within a group of people through an artifact with multiple functionalities and observe how the users iterate with it.

The intent is to analyze how the prototype can generate an environment for a sharing experience in a situated community space through music and food, a non-language means of connecting with similar or different cultural backgrounds.

Data collection will be followed through the artifact itself, by having conversations with the participants, analyzing the reactions and the way how they use it.

Weâ€™ll gather information and feedback from the experience process between the users, in the invisible bubble space.
